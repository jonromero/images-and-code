This is a very special webcomic.

Why?
Check this out.

1. It's community-based. You can clone the git, make a branch and maybe your comic will merge back to main!
2. It's running from git (so you can clone it, get notifies, download everything etc)
3. It's in pure javascript!
4. You can distribute the comic by sending the javascript and tell to put it to the url bar!
   The latest comic will be downloaded dynamically (that is in javascript) and execute!
5. A small engine (that has a crude version of templates) is written in Python and does
   the pre-rendering :D

How to submit a comic
---------------------
First, clone the git. Then download the latest version at your machine.
Place your image in png format in the same directory as the pyImg2js.py
and name it image.png. Run python pyImg2js.py. The output.html has the result
which you can test. Commit the result (remember not to commit the png).
As the project moves on, I'll make a more detailed procedure (and some 
major refactoring!). 


Huge TODOS:
-----------
First of all, I should use timers in javascript 'cause now I lock the whole browser :D
There are other minor glitches but the whole thing works :D

Enjoy!
