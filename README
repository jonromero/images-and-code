This is a very special webcomic.

Why?
Check this out.

1. It sucks :D (but pleeease keep reading)
2. It's running from git (so you can clone it, get notifies, download everything etc)
3. It's in pure javascript! (yeap things are getting more interesting...)
4. You can distribute the comic by sending the javascript and tell to put it to the url bar!
   The latest comic will be downloaded dynamically (that is in javascript) and execute!
5. A small engine (that has a crude version of templates) is written in Python and does
   the pre-rendering :D


Huge TODOS:
-----------
First of all, I should use timers in javascript 'cause now I lock the whole browser :D
There are other minor glitches but the whole thing works :D

Enjoy!
